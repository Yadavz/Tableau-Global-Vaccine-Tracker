The Global COVID-19 Dashboard is a data visualization project that tracks the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using Tableau, a business intelligence and data analytics platform. The project utilizes data obtained from Our World in Data through an Excel file to track four key performance indicators: total confirmed cases, total deaths, total recovered, and active cases. The project includes several interactive visualizations, including a global confirmed cases map, a global death rate map, a daily confirmed cases and deaths line chart, and a top 10 countries by confirmed cases bar chart. The data is automatically refreshed each time the workbook is opened, ensuring that the visualizations always reflect the latest available data. The project requires Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader version 2020.4 or later and an internet connection to access the data sources.

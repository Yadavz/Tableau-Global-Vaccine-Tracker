- Active Cases: This KPI tracks the total number of active cases of COVID-19 worldwide.

## Tableau Visualizations

The project includes several interactive visualizations that help to illustrate the global impact of COVID-19. Some of the key visualizations include:

- Global Confirmed Cases Map: This map visualizes the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 by country, with darker shades indicating a higher number of cases.

- Global Death Rate Map: This map visualizes the death rate of COVID-19 by country, with darker shades indicating a higher death rate.
